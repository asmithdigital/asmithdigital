# About me

My name is Andrew Smith and I am a **front-end web developer and digital design specialist**. I have worked in-house for many organisations such as <a href="//adelaide.edu.au">The University of Adelaide</a> and <a href="//privatemedia.com.au">Private Media</a>, and I also do some freelance work. Most of my work is in private repositories but you can see a selection on my most recent projects below.
